# ClusterTruck
This is an autosplitter for Clustertruck, fully integrated into livesplits XML database.
## Usage
To use, just go to Edit Splits, and click Activate. From now on, once you start a level, splits will begin automatically. 
Be sure to check out your settings first though, as you need to change them depending on what kind of run you are doing
## Settings
In the settings there are 2 options that determine how the autosplitter will behave.
#### Split Every Level
If this is on, then it will split for each level that you are on. when this is off, it will instead only split for each biome or area
#### Single Area Splits
This allows you to have splits for just a single area instead of the whole game. This option takes precedence over the previous option, no matter if its on or off.
#### Dev Mode
Dont use this unless you know what you are doing. This does disable some functionality.
