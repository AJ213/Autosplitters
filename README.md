# ClusterTruck
This is an autosplitter for Clustertruck, fully integrated into livesplits XML database.
## Usage
To use, just go to Edit Splits, and click Activate. From now on, once you start a level, splits will begin automatically. 
Be sure to check out your settings first though, as you need to change them depending on what kind of run you are doing
## Settings
In the settings there are 2 options that determine how the autosplitter will behave.
#### Full Game
This is the default way to run the game from 1:1 to the end. leave this on if you are doing any official runs
#### Individual Worlds
This will allow you to run individual worlds instead of the whole game (Does Overide any%)
#### Dev Mode
Dont use this unless you know what you are doing. This does disable some functionality.
#### Reset
the autosplitter will reset when you go back a level. it does not reset when you just go to the level select screen. makes resetting your runs much easier.
