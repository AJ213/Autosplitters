# ClusterTruck
This is an autosplitter for Clustertruck, fully integrated into Livesplit’s XML database.
## Warning
Programs that affect Clustertruck’s memory will break the autosplitter. If the game was patched by the old autosplitter be sure to reverify the integrity of files or reinstall the game to remove the patch. Eye-tracking also has been known to cause issues too.
## Usage
To use, just go to Edit Splits, Ensure that the game dropdown is set to Clustertruck, and click Activate. From now on, once you start the first level of a world, splits will begin automatically. 
## Settings
In the settings, there are a couple of options that determine how the autosplitter will behave.
#### Split by Level
This is the default way to run the game from 1:1 to the end. Leave this on if you are doing any full game runs like any% or NoAbility.
Turning this false makes it split per world.
#### Only Start From Level Load
This prevents the autosplitter automatically starting if you press R in a level while the timer is off. this allows runs to only start from the level select screen.
#### Dev Mode
Don’t use this unless you know what you are doing. This does disable some functionality.
#### Reset (Automatically added by livesplit)
The autosplitter will reset when you go back a level. However, it does not reset when you go back to the level selection screen. Makes resetting your runs much easier.
